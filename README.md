# ♞ Chess Game

Live demo → **https://aramyst.github.io/chessgame/**

An interactive, single-page chess board built with vanilla **JavaScript**, **HTML5** and **CSS Grid**.  
The project follows clean **OOP** principles (`Piece`, `Board`, `Game`) and already implements:

- Turn tracking (white / black)  
- Piece selection and legal-move highlighting  
- Capture tracking (“jail” sidebar)  
- Check / checkmate detection  
- Win dialog and board reset  

---

🕹️ How to Play

Click a piece that belongs to whose turn it is.

Legal destination squares are ring-highlighted in gold.

Click a highlighted square to move. Captured pieces appear in the sidebar.

When the opponent is in check, “CHECK!” is shown in the status bar.

Checkmate triggers an alert and reloads the page for a fresh game.
